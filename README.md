# What is this all about

This project was created for the exam following the completion of the March 2023 issue of the 'WordPress for Developers' course by SoftUni. It would be next to meaningless to anybody who didn't take this course.

## Project contents
This project serves to demonstrate two skills:
* How to create a theme: transforming a bare-bone HTML-based theme into a WordPress compatible dynamic theme that uses native WP function calls to populate various fields
* How to create a plugin from scratch and doing some stuff with it (e.g. register a CPT and do stuff with the content)

As of this update, Part 1 is done. I will be updating the document with further progress.

## Update
Part 2 is almost done. THere is a 'Toons' CPT which allows visitors to vote for their favorite Disney princess. Only 3 choices because I don't have time, sorry.
